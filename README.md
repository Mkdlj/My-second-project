# 🐍 Python Learning Journey: From Zero to Hero

Welcome to my Python learning repository! 🚀 This is where I document my progress as I dive into the world of programming, starting from absolute zero using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

## 🏗️ Version 1.0: The Foundation
**"Understanding how computers see data"**

In this first version (V1), I focused on data conversion and understanding the relationship between numbers, characters, and binary code.

### 🔢 Features in V1:
* **Decimal to Binary Conversion:**
    * Converts standard base-10 integers into binary strings. 📈
    * Uses the `bin()` function to visualize the underlying data.
* **ASCII & Character Mapping:**
    * Translates any character (e.g., 'A') into its numerical **ASCII/Unicode** value using `ord()`. 🔠
    * Converts the resulting ASCII value into its binary equivalent. 🤖

## 🛠️ Environment & Tools
* **Language:** Python 3.x 🐍
* **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) 🟦
* **Status:** Version 1.0 (Stable) ✅

## 📊 Sample Output (V1)
```text
[Decimal] 43  =>  [Binary] 0b101011
[Char] 'A'  =>  [ASCII] 65  =>  [Binary] 0b1000001
